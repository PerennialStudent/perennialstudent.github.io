Political volatility, environmental issues, precarious labour markets, technological monopolies, managerial and investment short-termism are only a few challenges we face in society today.

At the 49th St. Gallen Symposium in Switzerland, I joined established and emerging leaders from various disciplines around the globe to discuss ideas on the possible approaches and challenges to change the current purpose of capital.

This article shares some of my thoughts on this topic.

## Introduction

For decades, society has benefitted from the immense economic development that has provided opportunities for and improved the wellbeing of many people. However, <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">there is a growing consensus that our economic model based on resource consumption and quarterly earnings evaluations cannot continue and must be transformed</span> (Barton, 2017; Bower & Paine, 2017; Leavy, 2012). For this purpose, more and more companies, institutions and individuals have started making conscious efforts to shift focus toward sustainable long-term gains and developments. However, it remains a challenging feat in most cases due to numerous difficulties, including the management of seemingly conflicting financial interests and the evaluation and appreciation of often intangible environmental and societal impacts.

In recent years, there is growing recognition for the importance of companies to benefit all stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers and the community in which they operate. We are also starting to see evidence that the effective management of a company’s environmental and societal impact is not necessarily at odds with its long-term financial performance (Beal et al., 2017; Dyllick & Muff, 2016). Companies that align with a clear purpose to drive long-term value creation and aim to benefit all stakeholders will accordingly increase the motivation of its employees, customer loyalty and trust, and gain support from dedicated investors and policymakers.

<span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">Despite knowing the value in having a positive long-term holistic impact, no objective and comparable metric exist to measure it.</span> The majority of companies and investors still rely on short-term financial performances to measure success. However, with the ever-increasing adoption of connected digital devices and new developments in data analytics, digitalisation will play a key role in evaluating companies’ holistic impact. The latest insights into holistic company performance will support informed decision-making by executives, employees, consumers and policymakers.

## The role of digitalisation

As society continues to progress in the information age, an ever-increasing amount of data is being created. While companies continue to devise innovative methods to collect data from their customers, information about companies is becoming increasingly available to consumers. The democratisation of technology, enabled by the abundance of cost-effective devices and access to digital information, has contributed to the shift in the balance of power in the market from corporations to the individual (Collins, 2010; Gulati, 2010). Thus, <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">to stay competitive, companies must shift focus away from making short-term gains for their shareholders and instead focus on creating long-term value and their relationship with all stakeholders</span> (Denning, 2011a).

There is an increasing focus on company performance in environmental and societal impact, and advances in data analytics are beginning to show its correlation to financial value for the long term (Beal et al., 2017; Denning, 2011a). As companies realise this, those with strong digital and analytical abilities can leverage the opportunity to communicate their values better and gain a competitive advantage. However, they remain the minority, and many companies do not yet have the capabilities to monitor or understand their holistic impact. Thus, often there are conflicting third-party generated performance reports about various company’s environmental and societal effects, which can confuse consumers, investors and policymakers.

The wave of digitalisation has already arrived, and digital and analytical capabilities should not remain a specialised set of skills possessed by a small group of elites. To effectively communicate their values and optimise performance, a clear understanding of their holistic impact is needed. <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">The difficulty remains in the lack of reliable and comparable data for measuring holistic impact and unequal distribution of digitalisation expertise</span> (Sabbagh, Friedrich, El-Darwiche, Singh, & Koster, 2013). The following six steps are proposed to curtail this problem. With digitalisation and advanced analytics, it is possible to transform the understanding and measure of company performance and move society toward conscious economic growth.

## Harnessing digitalisation for purpose

#### 1. An objective metric for environmental impact

A standardised metric is necessary to indicate a company’s impact on the environment and assess its ability to generate long-term growth. The environmental impact score is based on the objective measures and calculations of water and carbon utilisation. Firstly, the measure of water and carbon will include direct usage by the company and indirect use, for example, through suppliers and distributors. In addition, the measure will also include a fraction of the usage by organisations in which the company has investments in. To obtain the final metric for environmental impact, the sum of the total volume of water and carbon usage is divided by the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. Overall, this metric provides an objective measure of the impact on some aspects of the environment and monitors resource usage and operations costs. As <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">companies face increasing risk from environmental regulation and resource scarcity</span> (Cetinkaya, 2010; Kalaitzi, Matopoulos, Bourlakis, & Tate, 2018), the environmental impact metric will allow comparisons within and between sectors to help companies improve risk management for the long-term.

#### 2. An objective metric for societal impact

Companies have various influences on different members of society. However, the focus of the objective metric for societal impact will be on the most direct line of influence that a company has control over, which is its impact on employees. Firstly, the median guaranteed gross salary of company employees should be reported to estimate the immediate financial impact on the employees. Unlike the average salary, the median figure indicates the salary distribution within the company. Secondly, companies should sum up the average total annual training and development hours received by all its employees to estimate the commitment to developing their workforce. <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">As companies compete in a fast-moving, global economy, its talent pipeline is fast becoming a valuable source of competitive advantage</span> (Charan, Barton, & Carey, 2018; Denning, 2011b). The continuous professional development provided by companies benefit employees and improve the attractiveness of the company for future hires and its adaptability in the market. Finally, the median salary and average annual training hours are summed to obtain an objective metric for societal impact, focusing on its influence on its employees.

#### 3. The bonus impact score

Due to the diversity of businesses in the marketplace, the above metrics are not nearly enough to capture all values of a company’s holistic impact. They only serve as a start for building a comparable database. The bonus impact score aims to indicate the company’s positive impacts that are not captured by the objective metrics for environmental and societal impact. For example, the bonus score could consider the annual weight (in kg) of plastic waste that the volunteer efforts of a company have collected or the number of children reached by the company’s annual educational community outreach. Although the impacts captured by the bonus score may not have an immediate and direct correlation with a company’s revenues, the relationships built and trust gained through these efforts and the improved welfare of communities will prove worthwhile in the long term. Each company may choose its area of impact that aligns with the values of its stakeholders. Thus the bonus score will have a unique meaning for each company. Although the bonus score is not a comparable metric, it provides extra information to investors and consumers about the additional impacts companies have in the broader community.

#### 4. Establish radical transparency

Despite the prosperity society have gained from innovations created by companies and large corporations, there is an increasing proportion of the public that views corporations as sociopathic and its leaders as indifferent to everything other than the share price and personal benefits (Mayer, 2018). In addition, in several industries, it is apparent that some corporations have been permitted to consume almost all their competition (Tepper & Hearn, 2018). In response, <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">there is increased stress and volatility in the marketplace, and companies realise the need to prove themselves worthy of the public’s trust.</span> One step towards regaining the public’s trust is for a company to communicate its core values better and demonstrate its commitments by publishing metrics for environmental and societal impact and its bonus impact scores. The publication of such data can also help restore competition in the market by enabling investors and consumers to make better-informed decisions.

#### 5. Digitalisation strategies for targeted sectors

Despite knowing the potential benefits of analysing and publishing holistic impact, many companies may not have the capabilities and dedicated resources or be unwilling to undertake such tasks. Thus, policymakers should conceive strategies for these targeted sectors to enable digital and analytical abilities, which will create long-term value for the wider community. For example, policymakers may establish programs that provide specialised analytical services to companies that apply for assistance from the government. Policymakers should also develop incentive plans that encourage companies to publish their performance data on holistic impact. For example, companies that have increased their positive holistic impact may be eligible for tax discounts or nominal recognition and awards.

#### 6. Transforming foundational education

The core subjects taught in most schools today have remained the same as those introduced decades ago and often involve handwriting skills and memorisation of extensive basic facts that are becoming non-essential (Sabbagh et al., 2013). The next generation needs to be appropriately prepared to lead the digital transformation towards conscious economic growth. Thus, digital skills need to be made compulsory in the school curriculum from an early primary stage. By incorporating digital education into the school curriculum, students from a young age will learn to use technology to make their digital creations. In addition, they will develop problem-solving skills and be introduced to computational and design thinking and the capabilities of data analytics and artificial intelligence. <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">Digital technology is no longer an industry but increasingly becoming the driver for change in every business everywhere.</span> The next generation needs to be adequately prepared with future-ready skills to tackle some of the most challenging problems facing the environment and society.

The above six steps are proposed as a starting point to utilising digitalisation to transform the perception of value in businesses. With appropriate measurement approaches, it is possible to obtain objective and comparable metrics, which will better inform investors and consumers. The support from policymakers will ensure that businesses will have access to essential digital analytics skills in the short term and a constant supply of talented workforce for the future.

## Conclusion

There is an increasing disharmony between business and society, fuelled by the traditional business model of shareholder value maximisation and short-termism. At the same time, with the help of social media and instant communication, public pressures on companies are growing faster and having more significant consequences. <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">To restore public trust and maintain sustainable economic growth, companies and policymakers must work together as more companies and organisations broaden their long-term focus to include investment in environmental and societal impacts.</span> Enabled by an increasing number of measurement approaches and tools to analyse the holistic impacts, we gain more company and organisational insights than ever before. <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">Digitalisation will provide the means for quantifying the relationship between holistic impact and financial value, and this understanding will enable the drive toward sustainable, conscious economic growth.</span>
