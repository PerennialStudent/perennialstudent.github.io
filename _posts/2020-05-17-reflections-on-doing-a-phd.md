After submitting my thesis in late 2019, I was invited by my institution to write a reflection piece about my PhD journey.

Below is an edited version of the work, I hope it can provide some perspectives on the PhD.

I could not have imagined when I began my PhD in Physics all the fantastic experiences that would be presented to me.  Four years ago, when I was completing my Bachelor's degree at The University of Auckland, <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">I was focused on my studies and succeeded academically. However, I lacked the confidence to try new things.</span> Since then, my world has expanded to a broad interest in people, science, industry and policy. With the unfailing support of my supervisors and colleagues and lots of encouraging nudges from friends, I have completely surprised myself. I started a student organisation and accepted the role as its leader; travelled to many new countries; published several research articles and presented their results at conferences. I co-organised science outreach and professional development programs and was awarded prizes for a proposal to commercialise my research. In 2019, I was invited to Switzerland for a political economics conference where I shared my perspective as a young scientist on world issues and in the same year, completed an internship at the Office of the Prime Minister's Chief Science Advisor. A couple of years ago, I felt unsure where my career was heading, but now I feel excited to learn and explore all these new worlds.

It all began in 2016 when, along with a bunch of friends, I started a local student chapter of the international society for optics and photonics, SPIE.  I did not intend to take a leadership role at first. I just noticed that we did not have a student chapter and asked why.  In response, my colleagues and supervisors suggested I start one. <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">I was daunted at first. I had no idea how to start or lead an organisation!</span> A fellow PhD student who was the president of another student group offered to mentor me. We got a group of friends together, and with their support, I took on the role of president. This decision proved one of the best of my life. Not only has it taught me about leadership and teamwork, but it has also been a fantastic opportunity to get together with like minds to work on initiatives we all felt passionate about. We have organised regular science outreach activities and invited distinguished overseas researchers to participate in our seminars and discussions. With financial and logistical support from a national photonics research institution, the Dodd-Walls Centre, we continue to grow and expand the reach and impact of our activities.

The centre of my PhD was <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">my research on the development of a new technique to detect and monitor bacteria</span>. I enjoy the collaborative nature of my research and have learnt all kinds of new skills and perspectives.

In my first year of PhD, my supervisors supported my interests to enter a research commercialisation competition hosted by the national photonics research institution. I saw the potential for my research to improve antibiotic use and was interested in exploring its commercial potential. I prepared a written business proposal describing how to translate my research into a technology that saves lives and reduces the health-economic burden even in low-resource environments. I then pitched the idea to an investment panel, who provided valuable feedback and advice and eventually awarded me as a winner. This experience opened my eyes to the <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">business perspectives on science and technology and taught me the value of expanding scientific impact through commercial routes.</span>

Towards the end of my PhD, I became more and more interested in exploring the potential interdisciplinary roles scientists can have outside of the academic lab.  I am passionate about science, but I realise that <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">we need to learn how to work with people and understand different perspectives to solve many of the significant problems in the world.</span>  I had read and dabbled a bit in current affairs, so when the opportunity came up to do an internship with the Office of the Prime Minister's Chief Science Adviser, it seemed like the perfect opportunity. In my internship, I conducted a scoping review of the uses of artificial intelligence for education in New Zealand. The experience has expanded my perspective of how we, as scientists, can contribute to policy.

Looking back, there is no way I would trade my PhD experience for anything. I am grateful for the support of my supervisors, mentors and peers, who have always kept an eye out for opportunities and supported me to try new things. <span style="background-color: #b3e6c9">Work hard, but also enjoy life and all the opportunities it presents</span> â€“ this has been my recipe for a holistic PhD experience.
